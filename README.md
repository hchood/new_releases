### Problem decomposition

**STEP 1 - Pick a user story or feature.**

Let's start with viewing a list of new releases. What kind of page do we want? An albums index page.

**STEP 2 - Start with the HTTP request and build out the parts of your app till your feature is complete.**

What happens inside my app when I navigate to my "/albums" page? (Try it - you should get a "Sinatra doesn't know this ditty" message.)

* First, I look for a block in my `server.rb` file that matches the `GET /albums` request. Let me write that first:

  ```ruby
  # new_releases/server.rb

  require 'sinatra'

  get '/albums' do
  end
  ```

* Now, this `get '/albums'` block doesn't do much yet. Navigate to this page in the browser. What do I see? Nothing. What do I ultimately want to see? A list of albums.

* What's the next step for me to show all the albums? You could start in two places:
  1. Create the `index.erb` view, or
  2. Create an `@albums` instance variable to pass to the `index.erb` view.

* Let's start with adding the `index.erb` view.
  - Where should I put this view?
    - `new_releases/views/index.erb` vs.
    - `new_releases/views/albums/index.erb`
  - Now I have my view, I need to make sure it is rendered in the browser:
    ```ruby
    # new_releases/server.rb

    require 'sinatra'

    get '/albums' do
      erb :'albums/index'
    end
    ```

* What's next? Displaying the albums. What do I need to do to do that?
  - Read in albums from the CSV and create an `@albums` instance variable in my `get` block
  - Iterate over that `@albums` instance variable in my `index.erb` file

* Anything else? I need to link to each album's page.

Once complete, I can move on to the next user story.
